%feature("docstring") OT::SobolIndicesExperiment
"Experiment to computeSobol' indices.

Available constructors:
    SobolIndicesExperiment(*distribution, size, computeSecondOrder=True*)

    SobolIndicesExperiment(*experiment, computeSecondOrder=True*)

Parameters
----------
distribution : :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
    Distribution :math:`\mu` with an independent copula used to generate the
    set of input data.
size : positive int
    Size :math:`N` of each of the two independent initial samples.
    For the total size of the experiment see notes below.
experiment : :class:`~openturns.WeightedExperiment`
    Design of experiment
computeSecondOrder : bool, defaults to True
    Whether to add points to compute second order indices

Notes
-----
Sensitivity algorithms rely on the definition of specific designs.
The method generates design for the Saltelli method.
Such designs could be used for Jansen, Martinez and MauntzKucherenko methods.
This precomputes such input designs using distribution or experiment by
generating two independent samples and mixing columns of these ones to define
the huge sample (design).
If computeSecondOrder is disabled, result design is of size :math:`N*(d+2)`
where d is the input dimension.
If computeSecondOrder is enabled, design's size is :math:`N*(2d+2)`, see
[Saltelli2002]_, except in dimension 2.
Model's answer could be evaluated outside the platform.

Examples
--------
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> ot.RandomGenerator.SetSeed(0)
>>> formula = ['sin(pi_*X1)+7*sin(pi_*X2)*sin(pi_*X2)+' + \
...    '0.1*((pi_*X3)*(pi_*X3)*(pi_*X3)*(pi_*X3))*sin(pi_*X1)']
>>> model = ot.SymbolicFunction(['X1', 'X2', 'X3'], formula)
>>> distribution = ot.ComposedDistribution([ot.Uniform(-1.0, 1.0)] * 3, \
...                                         ot.IndependentCopula(3))
>>> size = 10
>>> experiment = ot.SobolIndicesExperiment(distribution, size, True)
>>> sample = experiment.generate()"
